# Simulation Results Summary

## Mass Model

The geometry includes:

* 0.4 mm Aluminum alloy
* 1 mm Beryllium plate
* Caliste-SO detector
* Insulators were not modeled.

The Beryllium components use the same material properties as those used in the STIX instrument.

   * **Photon Fluence:**
     100,000,000 / 1.44 ≈ 69,444,444 photons/cm²
3. **Photon Energy Range:** 0 to 150 keV

**Differential fluence:**
462,962 photons / (keV·cm²)

##  Response Matrix obtained from the simulation run

* Detector threshold set to 4 keV
* Incident photon energy range: 0 to 150 keV, divided into 1500 bins
* Energy deposition range: 0 to 150 keV, divided into 1500 bins
* The energy bins in the Excel file represent bin centers
* Values in the response matrix are the number of total recorded counts above the threshold 4 keV
* Only deposited energy values were used in constructing the response matrix
* Detector effects, such as near-surface phenomena and energy resolution smearing, were not included
